I am a research scientist at Google Brain. My research lies in the broad area of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in designing principled methods for improved robustness and generalization in machine learning, and in generative models of high dimensional data. I am also interested in using generative modeling, aspects of $$p(x)$$, towards improving generalization in discriminative models. 

Before Google, I was at IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY. Even before that, I graduated with a Ph.D. from Department of Computer Science at University of Maryland in 2013 where my advisor was [Hal Daum√© III](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal). In the distant past, I also spent time working on robust automatic speech recognition during my Masters at [CRSS](http://crss.utdallas.edu), advised by [John H. L. Hansen](http://www.utdallas.edu/~john.hansen).
